2 Variants:
On-board (Processor dependant) 
- Integrating the MD5 (Model file) along the on board code for processing.
- Onboard results need to be formatted before data transfer.

On the server (Might have some latency issues)
- Convert the telemetry data into a readable format by using python scripts. 
- Perfrom analysis on the realtime data and project the results on the dashboard.
